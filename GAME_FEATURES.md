- Elemental affinities (fire enemies weak to water, etc.)

## World and Exploration

**Location System**

- Each area has different enemy spawns and resource nodes
- Progressive difficulty scaling by area
- Safe zones (towns) for healing, shopping, crafting

**NPC and Shop System**
- Shopkeepers selling basic items and equipment

- Sell system for unwanted items
- Quest NPCs offering simple fetch or kill quests

## Magic and Abilities

- Persistent progression through save system

**Quality of Life Features**
- Auto-save functionality
- Difficulty scaling based on player level
- Clear help/tutorial information
- Input validation and error handling throughout

This feature list provides enough detail for an AI to understand the scope and interconnections between systems while maintaining focus on core RPG mechanics that work well in a text-based, turn-based format.  (And then things we can begin to work on in terms of the bones of the game/framework that needs to be added/fixed before we can focus on adding new items/enemys/etc))
